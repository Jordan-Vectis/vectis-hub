**Never:** invent staff/founders/quotes beyond Bryan Goodall + Mazillius, claim awards/superlatives, reference URLs other than vectis.co.uk, use the word "CRM", or expose internal BC auction codes (e.g. F025, DM0126) — these are staff-only references; use the human-readable sale name for public content.`,

# Vectis Hub

**Production URL:** https://vectis-crm-production.up.railway.app
**Staging URL:** https://vectis-staging.up.railway.app
**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/Jordan-Vectis/vectis-hub
**Local path:** C:\\Dev apps\\vectis-hub

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Prisma 7 with \`@prisma/adapter-pg\` (requires adapter — no direct URL in client)
- PostgreSQL on Neon
- NextAuth v5 beta (JWT sessions, Credentials provider)
- Hosted on Railway (auto-deploys: push to \`main\` → production, push to \`staging\` → staging)
- Socket.IO for live auction real-time events
- Google Gemini API (lot description generation, BC Marketing articles)
- Royal Mail Click & Drop API (packing/dispatch)
- Business Central OData API (BC Reports, BC Warehouse, BC Marketing)
- Cloudflare R2 for lot photo storage
- D-ID API for AI Presenter avatar

## Key config notes
- \`prisma generate\` runs as part of \`npm run build\`
- \`trustHost: true\` in \`auth.config.ts\` — required for Railway domain
- \`proxy.ts\` (not middleware.ts) — Next.js renamed middleware to proxy
- Auth split: \`auth.config.ts\` (Edge-safe) + \`auth.ts\` (full, uses Prisma)
- Prisma client generated at \`app/generated/prisma/\`
- \`DATABASE_URL\`, \`AUTH_SECRET\`, \`NEXTAUTH_URL\` set in Railway Variables
- \`prisma migrate deploy\` runs on startup via server.js (DATABASE_URL not available at build time)
- Jordan never runs the app locally — always uses the Railway staging URL

## Roles
- **ADMIN** — full access, hardcoded for it@vectis.co.uk
- **COLLECTIONS** — CRM, submissions, follow-ups
- **CATALOGUER** — cataloguing tools

## Git discipline
- Default branch for all work: \`staging\`
- Never push to \`main\` unless Jordan explicitly says "push to main"
- Always pull from remote staging before pushing (another developer works on the same branch)
- Merge to production: \`git fetch origin main && git checkout main && git merge origin/staging --no-edit && git push origin main && git checkout staging\`

## Admin section — current features
- **About** (\`/admin/about\`) — comprehensive documentation for every app, all sub-tabs, DB models, rules, dependencies, and hardcoded constants. Updated 2026-05-07.
- **Users & Permissions** — grouped by section matching hub page layout
- **Role Defaults** — default allowedApps + appPermissions per role, auto-applied on user creation
- **Home Page** — drag-to-reorder hub cards
- **Departments** — cataloguer department management
- **Cataloguing Reports** — time-per-lot stats
- **Run Migrations** — emergency SQL button (all migrations must also be added here)
- **Claude Memory** (\`/admin/memory\`) — static page with memory content hardcoded in ENTRIES array. Jordan can also upload .md files manually. Updated alongside memory files on each session.

## Hub page sections
- Cataloguing & AI: Auction AI, Cataloguing, BC Marketing
- Business Central: BC Reports, BC Warehouse, BC API Viewer
- Operations: Warehouse, Submissions, Customers, Databases, Packing/Dispatch
- Auction: Website, Auction Controller, Saleroom Trainer, AI Presenter
- Admin: standalone card

## Planned features
- iPad device tracking — register devices by localStorage UUID, check-in system showing who has each iPad`,

name: General Feedback & Collaboration Style
description: How Jordan likes to work — tone, approach, and patterns to avoid
type: feedback
---

Keep responses short — one paragraph max unless explaining something technical. Lead with the action or answer, skip preamble.

**Why:** User explicitly asked for concise answers early on.

**How to apply:** No summaries at the end of responses, no "here's what I did" recaps, no headers in conversational replies.

---

Jordan always uses the Railway staging URL — never runs the app locally. Any feature that only works locally is useless to him.

**Why:** Jordan got frustrated multiple times when features were built assuming local access (e.g. memory file reading from disk).

**How to apply:** Before building anything that reads from disk, env vars only available locally, or requires npm run dev — stop and think whether it will work on Railway. If not, find a different approach.

---

When Jordan says something simple like "take a copy and put it on the site", do exactly that — don't architect a syncing system with DB tables, API routes, and seed scripts.

**Why:** Jordan had to repeat himself multiple times while I kept overcomplicating the memory viewer.

**How to apply:** Match the complexity of the solution to the simplicity of the request. If they say "put a copy on the site", embed the content statically.

---

Don't suggest Jordan open the browser console or run commands to fix things.

**Why:** Jordan called this out as a bad suggestion when I told him to run fetch() in the console to trigger a migration.

**How to apply:** Any admin operation that might need to be triggered manually must have a proper UI button (like the Run Migrations button).`,

    content: `---
name: Memory file workflow
description: When updating memory files, always update the static page content at the same time
type: feedback
---

The Claude Memory viewer at /admin/memory is a static page — the memory content is hardcoded directly into \`app/(app)/admin/memory/page.tsx\` as a const ENTRIES array.

**Rule:** Whenever memory files are written or updated, also update the corresponding entry in the ENTRIES array in the page file and push to staging.

**Why:** Jordan can't run the app locally, so the only way he can see updated memory is if it's baked into the deployed page. A memory file written to disk but not reflected in the page is invisible to him.

**How to apply:** At the end of any session where memory files are written, update \`app/(app)/admin/memory/page.tsx\` with the new content and commit + push to staging in the same operation.`,

    filename: "feedback_file_saving.md",

name: Always ask before saving files
description: Ask the user where to save files before saving them
type: feedback
---

Always ask the user where they want files saved before saving them. Do not assume Desktop or any other default location.

**Why:** User was annoyed when a Word document was saved to their Desktop without being asked.

**How to apply:** Any time a file is being created/saved (documents, exports, downloads), ask "Where would you like me to save this?" before proceeding.`,

  {
    filename: "feedback_naming.md",
    content: `---
name: App naming
description: Don't call it a CRM — it's just one section of the whole app
type: feedback
---

Don't refer to the Vectis app as "the CRM". It is just "the app". CRM is only one section of it and using that label causes confusion.

**Why:** User corrected this explicitly — calling it a CRM is inaccurate and could cause misunderstanding about what's being worked on.

**How to apply:** Always say "the app" when referring to the overall Vectis Next.js application.`,

    filename: "feedback_migrations.md",
    content: `---
name: Migration pattern for Vectis Hub
description: Always back new migrations with a run-migrations endpoint entry; prisma migrate deploy is unreliable on Railway
type: feedback
---

Database migration errors are a recurring problem on Railway staging/production. \`prisma migrate deploy\` can fail silently on startup.

**Rule:** Whenever a new Prisma migration is added, also add the equivalent \`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS\` or \`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS\` SQL to the \`MIGRATIONS\` array in \`app/api/admin/run-migrations/route.ts\`.

**Why:** The Run Migrations button on /admin gives Jordan a one-click fix without needing console commands or redeployment.

**How to apply:** Any time a schema change is made, update both the migration file AND the run-migrations endpoint in the same commit.`,

    filename: "feedback_git_workflow.md",

name: Git push workflow for Vectis Hub
description: Always pull from remote staging before pushing — another developer also pushes to staging
type: feedback
---

Another developer works on the same staging branch. Always pull before pushing, not after, so our commits go on top cleanly.

**Rule:** Before pushing to staging, run \`git pull origin staging\` first, then push.

**Why:** Git rejects pushes when the remote is ahead of local. Pulling first avoids force-pushing which would overwrite the other developer's work.

**How to apply:** Every time I'm about to push to staging, pull first. At the start of a session is ideal.`,
